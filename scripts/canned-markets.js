Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller \"burps\" due to tectonic events. Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

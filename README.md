Augur App is a small electron application that packages [Augur Node](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-node) and the [Augur UI](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur), so you can use Augur locally with an Ethereum node of your choosing.

## To Use

The easiest way to get started is to simply download one of the OS specific installers [here](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-app/releases).

### On Windows

After installing on Windows, you will need to manually create a shortcut to the executable to avoid slow startup times. The installed executable can be found at `%LocalAppData%\augur-app\augur-app.exe`

### On Ubuntu

First, install dependencies:

```bash
$ apt-get install libgconf2-4
```

Then, install the `.deb` package with `sudo dpkg -i augur-app_1.0.0_amd64.deb`. Once installed, run the app from the command line:

```bash
augur-app
```

### From source

If you want to run Augur App from source, you will need git and npm installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-app
# Go into the repository
cd augur-app
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app. NOTE: This will have to install native dependencies which may take a long time depending on your environment.
npm start
```

Once the application is running, wait for the Sync progress to reach 100%, then the "Open Augur UI" button will light up and you can click on it to open the Augur UI. Note that the Augur App must remain open while using the UI, or it will stop functioning.

If the instructions above don't work try:

```git clone https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-app
yarn
yarn start
```

### To build the binary

Do: `npm run make`

## Augur Node Network Configuration

The Augur Rinkeby node configuration and a "Local" configuration are provided by default, specifying HTTP and WebSocket endpoints for a full Ethereum node. To connect to mainnet, you must either run your own full node and use the "Local" configuration, or provide the connection details for a hosted node that you trust. The "Custom" configuration is intended for this purpose, but will, by default, also just point to localhost.

## Logging

The location of the log file is operating system specific.

### On Mac

~/Library/Logs/augur

### On Linux

## Ledger support

Ledger needs SSL support. To use Ledger and support SSL in Augur, follow these instructions:

### On Mac

The following commands need openssl, use brew or other package manager to install openssl.
Then in a command line, run:

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -keyout notaugur.key -out localhost.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=localhost/OU=local/CN=localhost"

    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in localhost.csr -signkey localhost.key -out localhost.crt

This will make two files, `localhost.key` and `localhost.crt`. Move these files to your Augur application data directory: `~/Library/Application Support/augur`

Then start up your Augur application. When you open Augur in your web broswer, you will have to tell web browser to trust the site.

## Gotchas

- If you are doing active development on other Augur repos, make sure to close out any running Augur Node or Augur UI instances and any clients that may be connected to them before running. We use hardcoded ports, and if they can't be used, the App will not run properly.
- Make sure whatever you are using to connect to an Ethereum node on the UI is looking at the same network as your Augur Node configuration. For example, if you are using MetaMask, and you are running Augur App with a Rinkeby configuration, make sure that MetaMask is also connected to Rinkeby!
